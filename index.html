                <h2>Game Explanation</h2>
                <p>The game Pairs is an appealing alternative to a traditional memory game for adults. The pictures used show animals. 
                    Practizing Pairs on a regular basis could be a nice brain exercise. You can improve your score or time or you can 
                    play around with the different options. In short you can look at different images and afterwards you have to find 
                    out where the wanted tile is.</p>

                <h2>Game Rules</h2>
                <p>After reading the rules carefully push the button "Go to game" below this text. From there you will find your self 
                    at the game page. But before you can start a game you have to choose from the different option availble. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Choose from the dropdown menu how many tiles should be displayed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choose how long you want to look at these tiles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choose how you want the comparison tile (same picture, letters <!--or animal sound-->)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                     After you have chosen your wanted options start the game. The timer above the shown tiles counts down the wanted 
                     time for remember the tiles and their position. As soon as the time runs out. The animal tiles are turned and the 
                     comparison tile is revealed. Your time for thinking is will be counted by timer 2. As soon as you click on a turned 
                     tile the answer is revealed. From there you can continue playing the game or go back to change the options.
