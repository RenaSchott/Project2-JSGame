            <h3>Game Explanation</h3>
            <p>
              The game Pairs is an appealing alternative to a traditional memmory
              game for adults. The pictures used show animals. Practizing Pairs on
              a regular basis could be a nice brain exercise. You can improve your
              score or time. In short you can look at different images and 
              afterwards you have to find out where the wanted tile is.
